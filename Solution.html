        <h3>Click the picture to explore how colorful lights function.</h3>
        <p>Utilizing traffic light colors that are currently non-functional can serve as an innovative temporary solution to manage road traffic. 
            By repurposing these lights through manual signaling or alternative power sources, authorities can guide drivers safely at 
            intersections, reduce confusion, and improve traffic flow. This approach helps maintain order until full repair or restoration is 
            completed.</p>
