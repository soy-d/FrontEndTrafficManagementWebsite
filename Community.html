            </marquee>
        <p>As part of a broader effort to improve public safety and transportation efficiency, a 
            social awareness session was conducted in Ja-Ela focusing on the growing issue of road 
            traffic and congestion. This session aimed to educate the local community—including 
            pedestrians, motorists, and students—about responsible road behavior, traffic rule 
            adherence, and the importance of cooperation between road users. Emphasis was placed on 
            understanding how minor violations and lack of awareness contribute to large-scale traffic 
            problems, especially during peak hours. The session also introduced practical solutions, 
            such as using alternative routes, public transport, and real-time traffic monitoring tools 
            like Google Maps. Through open discussions and presentations, the session encouraged 
            participants to become active contributors to safer and more organized road environments in the 
            Ja-Ela area.</p>
