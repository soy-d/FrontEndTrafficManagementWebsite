        <h1 style="color: aqua;">The Daily Struggle: Why Our Roads Are So Congested</h1>
        <p>Every day in areas like Ja-Ela, and across Sri Lanka, road traffic presents a major
             challenge for everyone. This isn't just about having too many cars; it's a complex problem caused by <strong>three main issues</strong> working together: outdated roads,
             driver behaviour, and poor planning.</p>
        <p>The most basic problem is that our road network is not built for today's world. The number of cars, motorcycles, and three-wheelers has exploded in recent years, but the
             roads themselves have largely stayed the same. Many are narrow, old, and full of bottlenecks like busy junctions and railway crossings that bring everything to a halt. We are 
             trying to fit a river's worth of traffic into a stream's channel, and the result is a constant jam.</p>
        <p>Just as important as the roads themselves is <strong>how people use them</strong>. The driving culture in Sri Lanka adds to the chaos. There is often very little
             respect for lane discipline, with drivers weaving across the road without warning. Aggressive driving is common, especially from buses competing for passengers. When you 
             add 
             the unpredictable nature of motorcycles and tuk-tuks, which fill every tiny gap, the flow of traffic becomes messy, inefficient, and dangerous for everyone.
            </p>
        <p>Finally, a lack of good planning makes everything worse. New shops and buildings are often built without providing enough parking, forcing people to park on 
            the side of the road and block a lane. Furthermore, our roads are shared by a chaotic mix of vehicles—from huge, slow-moving lorries to fast motorcycles and bulky 
            buses—all competing for the same limited space. This mix makes it impossible to have a smooth or steady flow of traffic.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the traffic we face every day is not a single problem but a tangle of issues. It is a mix of an infrastructure that is too small, a driving 
            culture that creates chaos, and planning that has not kept pace with growth. This combination wastes our time, fuel, and adds a huge amount of stress to our 
            daily lives.</p>
